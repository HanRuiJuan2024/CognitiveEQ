# Cohort-Driven Learning Optimization Model (CDLOM)


## Project Overview

Emotional intelligence (EI) is an essential factor in modern educational settings, yet traditional teaching methods often fail to address its integration into classroom instruction. This project introduces the **Cohort-Driven Learning Optimization Model (CDLOM)**, an innovative framework designed to monitor and optimize students' emotional and cognitive states in real-time, utilizing EEG data and personalized EI interventions.

### Key Highlights:
- **Dynamic Emotional State Monitoring:** Leverages EEG-based technologies to capture real-time emotional and cognitive state data.
- **Personalized Interventions:** Provides tailored emotional intelligence (EI) training to address individual student needs.
- **CDLOM Framework:** Employs recurrent architectures and interaction networks to optimize learning states dynamically.
- **Behavioral Impact:** Demonstrates significant improvements in classroom behavior metrics, including engagement, collaboration, and emotional regulation.
